     marks is between 0 and 100(both inclusive)
     a student qualifies for admission, if
     age and marks are valid and marks is 65 or more
     write a python program to represent the students seeking admission in the university.
    RULES TO FOLLOW
    the details of student class are given below.
    Class name:student
    attributes :(private)
    student_id
    marks
    age methods:-(public) __init__(), validate_marks(),validate_age(),check_qualification()
    continuing with the previous scenarios, a student eligible for admission has to choose a course and pay the fees for it. if they have scored more than 85 marks in qualifying
    exam, they get 25% discount on fees.
    valid course ids and fees are given below:
